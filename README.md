# avlTree

Simple AVL Tree where you can insert and remove nodes from a balanced tree

The output of the program shows each number and its level in the tree in the format "number,level". Level 0 is the root of the tree.

To insert a node (for example number 3) just type "i 3"\
To remove the node type "r 3"\
To end the program in linux terminal and see the tree press "Ctrl + D"

If you want to use the input from a file and get the output to another file just run "./avlTree.c < file1.in > file2.out" in linux terminal.

Just download the code and compile it with gcc, then you can run it in the terminal.
